# Introduction

This template allows writing stylish articles in Markdown with Quarto[^1].
It directly produces well-formatted PDF articles for self-archiving or in other formats, for example HTML.

[^1]: <https://quarto.org/>

# Local scale



# Regional scale



# Code 

## Figures

```{r}
#| label: fig-pressure
#| fig-cap: "Figure _title_ with maths : $\\pi$ and cross-reference to @tbl-kable"
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-env: "figure*"
plot(pressure)
```

Figures can be created by R code (@fig-pressure).
A label is associated with each figure: its name is given in the `#| label:` option of the chunk that produces it.
It must start with `fig-`.
Cross-references are made with the command `@label`, e.g.: `@fig-pressure`.

In PDF, a figure can use the full width of the page by adding the options `fig-env="figure*"` to the header of the code chunk that generates it.

Existing figures are integrated into a piece of code by the `include_graphics()` function, see @fig-logo.

```{r}
#| label: fig-logo
#| fig-cap: "Logo"
#| out-width: 30%
knitr::include_graphics("images/logo.png")
```

Systematically place these files in the `images` folder for the automation of GitHub pages.

## Tables

The horizontal `-` and vertical separators `|` allow you to draw a table according to Markdown syntax, but this is not the best method in R.

Tables can also be produced by R code.
The content of the table is in a dataframe.
The `kbl()` function prepares the table for display and passes the result to `kable_styling()` for final formatting.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-kable
#| tbl-cap: "Table _created_ by R, with $\\pi$. Dummy legend to demonstrate formatting capacities."
#| echo: false
#| tidy: false

names(iris) <- c(
  "Sepal length", 
  "Width", 
  "Petal length", 
  "Width", 
  "Species"
)
head(iris) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(
    # Tables can be longer than a page
    longtable = TRUE, 
    # Nice separators
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    # Striped rows for readability
    bootstrap_options = "striped"
  )
```

The caption is specified by the `#| tbl-cap:` chunk option.

Always use the `booktabs = TRUE` argument so that the separator lines are optimal in LaTeX.
The `bootstrap_options = "striped"` option provides more readable tables in HTML.

In LaTeX, `longtable = TRUE` selects the "longtable" package to format tables.
Such tables are placed in the text.
Due to limits of the "longtable" package which does not support multi-column layouts, the Stylish Article template uses a workaround that does not allow really long tables to be split into several columns or pages.
So, `longtable = TRUE` only means that the table will be one-column wide and located in the text if possible.
If not, it will float.

To use the full width of the page, like @tbl-Paracou, `longtable` is set to `FALSE` in the arguments of `kbl()`.
The option `full_width = TRUE` in `kable_styling()` allows adjusting the width of the table to that of the page.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-Paracou
#| tbl-cap: "Large table with maths, on two columns"
#| echo: false

Intervention <- data.frame(
  Treatment = c("Control", "T1", "T2", "T3"),
  Timber = c(
    "", 
    "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha", 
    "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha",
    "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, commercial species, $\\approx$ 10 trees/ha"
  ),
  Thinning = c(
    "", 
    "", 
    "DBH $\\geq$ 40 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 30 trees/ha", 
    "DBH $\\geq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha  "
  ),
  Fuelwood = c(
    "", 
    "", 
    "", 
    "40 cm $\\leq$ DBH $\\leq$ 50 cm, non-valuable species, $\\approx$ 15 trees/ha"
  ),
  AGBLost = c(0, "$[12\\%-33\\%]$", "$[33\\%-56\\%]$", "$[35\\%-56\\%]$")
)
names(Intervention)[5] <- "\\%AGB lost"
Intervention %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(
    # Full width table
    longtable = FALSE, 
    # Nice separators
    booktabs = TRUE, 
    # Special characters in the table
    escape = FALSE
  ) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    # Striped rows for readability
    bootstrap_options = "striped", 
    # Full width table
    full_width = TRUE
  )
```

This table contains mathematics: the `escape = FALSE` argument is necessary in `kable()`.
This feature is not yet supported by Quarto in the HTML output.

Finally, the `full_width = TRUE` argument in `kable_styling()` adjusts the width of the table to the available width.
It must be set for correct formatting of two-column tables in LaTeX.

Note that tables can't be shown on the first page of the PDF output of the Stylish Article template: they would conflict with the table of contents.

## Lists

Lists are indicated by `*`, `+` and `-` (three hierarchical levels) or numbers `1.`, `i.` and `A.` (numbered lists).
Indentation of lists indicates their level: `*`, `+` and `-` may be replaced by `-` at all levels, but four spaces are needed to nest a list into another.

-   First element of a list
    -   sub-list
-   Second element
-   Continuation of the list

Leave an empty line before and after the list, but not between its items.

## Math

Equations in LaTeX format can be inserted inline, like $A = \pi r^2$ or isolated like $$e^{i \pi} = -1.$$

They can be numbered, see @eq-disk, after adding them a label:

$$
  A = \pi r^2.
$$ {#eq-disk}

## Cross-references

Figures and tables have a label declared in their code chunk option `tbl-cap` or `fig-cap`, starting with `fig-` or `tbl-`.

For equations, the label is added manually by the code `{#eq-xxx}` after the end of the equation.

Sections can be tagged by ending their title with `{#sec-yyy}`.

In all cases, the call to the reference is made by `@`.

## Bibliography

Bibliographic references included in the `.bib` file declared in the document header can be called by `[@CitationKey]`, in parentheses [@Xie2018], or without square brackets, in the text, as @Xie2016.

The bibliography is processed by Pandoc when producing Word or HTML documents.
The bibliographic style can be specified, by adding the line

```         
csl: file_name.csl
```

in the document header and copying the *.csl* style file to the project folder.
More than a thousand styles are available[^5] and their URL can be used instead of copying the file, e.g.:

[^5]: <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>

```         
csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/xxx
```

For PDF documents, the bibliography is managed by natbib.
The style is declared in the header:

```         
biblio-style: chicago
```

It can be changed as long as the appropriate `.bst` file (by default: `chicago.bst`) is included in the project.

## Forcing line breaks

Hyphenation is handled automatically in LaTeX.
If a word is not hyphenated correctly, add its hyphenation in the preamble of the file with the command `hyphenation` (words are separated by spaces, hyphenation locations are represented by dashes).

If LaTeX can't find a solution for the line break, for example because some code is too long a non-breaking block, add the LaTeX command `\break` to the line break location.
Do not leave a space before the command.
The HTML document ignores LaTeX commands.


## Text color

This template includes the "color-text" filter for Quarto.
It makes colored text possible using the `[content]{color=<name>}` syntax.
[This is a red example]{color="red"}.
Defined colors are blue, green and red.
To add more colors, they must be defined in the document header in `format:`, `stylisharticle-pdf:`, `header-includes:` .
This is the code for "grey":

```         
    \definecolor{grey}{RGB}{191, 191, 191}
```

They must also be included in a `.css` file declared in `format:`, `stylisharticle-html:`

```         
    css: colors.css
```

In this css, colors are declared by

```         
.color-grey {color: rgb(191, 191, 191);}
```
